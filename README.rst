Introduction
============

easyply is a helper library for PLY, parser generator for Python. It
acts as a middleware between your grammar definition and PLY.

What's so appealing about easyply? PLY supports rather crude parser
definitions; easyply adds some EBNF-y flavor to it. easyply is purely
a helper in everyday work - you definitely need to understand PLY first 
in order to use this library.

Goodies
=======

Currently, there are three nice additions to the normal PLY syntax:

No mandratory whitespace surrounding colon sign
-----------------------------------------------

::

  def px_rule():
    "production: SYMBOL

Named parameters
----------------

Instead of mutating and reading from the mysterious `p` parameters,
easyply employs named parameters and return values. So::

  def px_rule(id):
    "production: {ID}
    ...
    return retval

is equivalent to::

  def p_rule(p):
    "production : ID"
    id = p[1]
    ...
    p[0] = retval

You can also used custom names for parameters, just like this::

  def px_rule(foo):
    "production: {ID:foo}"

Optional symbols
----------------

Instead of creating multiple similar rules differing only by a few symbols,
you can consolidate them into one using `?` symbol. Observe::

  def px_rule():
  "production: symbol1 symbol2? symbol3"
  ...

Given this code, easyply will generate two functions with the
same code and the following rules:

  + `production: symbol1 symbol3`
  + `production: symbol1 symbol2 symbol3`

This is especially powerful in conjunction with named parameters(note the parentheses)::

  def px_list(expression, list = ()):
    "list: ({list} COMMA)? {expression}"
    return list + expression

Neat, isn't it?

Installation
============

::
  
  pip install easyply  

Usage
=====

Basic usage is simple: Prefix all your easyply rules with `px_` prefix
(instead of the usual `p_`) and call `easyply.process_all(globals())`
before creating your PLY parser. If your want more fine grained control,
consult the API reference.
